This solution demonstrates how to correctly handle Firebase document snapshots by first verifying the document's existence:
```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(snapshot => {
  if (snapshot.exists) {
    console.log(snapshot.data().myField); // Access properties only if document exists
  } else {
    console.log('Document does not exist'); // Handle the case where the document doesn't exist
  }
});
```
This improved code avoids the error by checking `snapshot.exists`. If the document exists, then and only then, does it access the properties. If not, it provides alternative handling (in this case, logging that the document doesn't exist).  This prevents runtime errors caused by trying to access properties of `undefined`.
